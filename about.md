# Who We Are

CVBi is an independent research cluster founded by a group of young and passionate professionals who share a collective ambitious goal “to decarbonize the building industry in India”.

# Ethos

CVBi firmly believes in democratizing the collective voices of the scientific community in a responsible manner such that it guides the society (industry, governance, academia) towards decarbonization pathways (in the future) with strategic and concrete action plans based on evidences.

# How it started?
In March 2021, Balaji Kalluri, one of the co-founders of this cluster who was then Heading Innovation in e-Governance in the state of Tamil Nadu, made a bold statement to other co-founders (Chirag Deb, Jay Dhariwal, Prashant Anand, and Pandarasamy Arjunan) expressing his interest to collaboratively build an independent research cluster. The BOLD vision is to digitally transform the building industry in India as a strategic move towards enabling the green-transition. The idea emerged from collective observations on national and global trends surrounding digital transformation plus carbon-neutral commitments made by the nation in the COP26 summit.

# Charter

## Original Goal
To carry out nationwide building energy benchmarking exercises in India at a scale and report insights, challenges, best practices, and barriers which should be the first of such kind in India.


## Our Strategic Plan
We are provoked to think BIG, can we take advantage of our strategic locations, our shared interest, and our mutual network of connections to set up nationwide consortia, let's say one city in North (Delhi) led by Jay, East (Kolkatta) led by Prashant, West (Bombay) led by Chirag and South (Chennai) led by Bala to begin with.
