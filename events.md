# 1. The First International ACM SIGEnergy Workshop on Advancements in Building Energy Benchmarking Systems (BenchSys 2022)
Building energy benchmarking is a proven energy management strategy that can positively quantify - and relatively quickly provide objective and reliable information on building energy use and the benefits of improvements. Energy benchmarking is a growing practice in many cities across the world as part of the energy disclosure policy. Many cities have already started to reap the benefits of energy benchmarking with up to 8% energy savings. However, there remains a gap in the widespread adaptation of benchmarking methodologies in terms of their scalability and standardization (data acquisition, analytics, validation, reporting, and automation). Several government organizations, industry practitioners, and researchers are working towards building a holistic and standardized energy benchmarking system.

The ACM SIGEnergy international workshop on “Advances in Building Energy Benchmarking” invites papers on the current developments in building energy benchmarking. Researchers and practitioners working on data acquisition technology and processes, data sharing protocols and policies, benchmarking modeling methodologies, standardization and widespread adoption, strategy and collaboration, case studies, open source platforms and crowdsourcing are invited to participate. The workshop also aims to explore the existing challenges in data acquisition techniques in emerging economies. It will foster a discussion on the widespread adoption of energy benchmarking methods while bringing together researchers and practitioners from diverse backgrounds to discuss related challenges and breakthroughs.

[BenchSys 2022](https://benchsys.github.io/2022/) is co-located with [ACM SenSys/BuildSys 2022](https://buildsys.acm.org/2022/).

# 3. Summer School '23: 
Spend your upcoming summer vacation with us (tenatively in July'23). Join for a 3 week long fun-filled, interactive and experiential learning on a multi-disciplinary course in [FLAME University](https://flame.edu.in/). The course is titled "Technology and Economics of Complex Urban Systems" and is uniquely tailored to create a bespoke educational content blending computational methods, economics, strategic innovation and design-thinking applied to complex urban systems such as cities, communities and buildings. The venue for this summer school is ideally located in picturesque Sahyadri Hill range in Maharastra between Pune and Mumbai. It will bring international experts from academia, industry, consulting, policy makers, and NGOs to broaden students perspectives at UG-level (Please stay tuned for more details in coming weeks)
